# ðŸŽˆ Experimental Claude-based customer support bot

This project was born out of a unique intersection between my company's needs and my curiosity about Claude. The primary goal is to investigate whether a combination of prompt engineering and RAG integration would suffice for my company's customer support requirements.

A key aspect of this project that intrigues me is evaluating the utility of Anthropic's console in creating an optimal user experience for our customers. I am actively exploring how to define testing parameters and metrics, leveraging the tools in the Workbench. The true value of these tools in a production environment has yet to be determined.

My journey with AI language models began with ChatGPT, which I've been using since 2022. In 2023, I started using Claude 2 in my normal workflow, allowing me to compare and contrast these models. While my initial experience with prompt engineering for ChatGPT through CustomGPT was challenging, I acknowledge that I hadn't delved deeply into understanding the intricacies of LLMS or OpenAI's documentation at that time. A revisit might be warranted, especially if various modal integrations for CustomGPTs become possible in the future.

As a consumer, I have had positive experiences with both ChatGPT and Claude. However, this project presents an opportunity to engage with these tools at a deeper level, leveraging their APIs for practical applications. This hands-on experience will allow me to better evaluate whether the feature development of these two companies aligns with their stated directions.

Through this project, I aim to not only solve a practical business need but also gain valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of current AI technologies in specific applications.
